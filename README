Thinglonger
-----------

Now you don't need to build a 'what-if' machine to see what life would be like if
you had built a Thinglonger -- it already exists! This Chrome extension wakes up
on Demonoid.me results pages and adds a new event handler to all:

style links. The new click() prevents the default action and instead downloads
the torrent over AJAX into an ArrayBuffer (using a modified[1] version of jQuery
that supports the "dataType: binary" directive). That ArrayBuffer is then base64
encoded[2] for safe keeping into a variable and POSTed to an arbitrary server
that listens for /rtorrent POST requests.

Included in the repo is a simple Bottle server.py that listens for those requests
and writes the torrent to the local filesystem. This can be used in conjunction
with rtorrent's 'watch' folder to automatically start the torrent on a remote
server after clicking the download link locally.
